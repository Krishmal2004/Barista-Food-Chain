The customer service was exceptional  the staff was incredibly friendly, making me feel right at home.

I tried the Winter Gingerbread Mocha, which had the perfect balance of spices and sweetness. It was the ideal drink to start my day. The Cheese and Tomato Sandwich was silky smooth, while the Forest Berry Iced Tea was refreshing and just what I needed. I also indulged in the Chicken Salami and Cream Cheese Simit, a flavorful and cheesy treat that satisfied my cravings.

Additionally, I had the pleasure of participating in their Share a Meal Campaign, supporting SOS Children's Village Sri Lanka. It was heartwarming to know that my visit contributed to a cause that helps children and families in need.

Overall, Barista Sri Lanka provided a fantastic experience – from the delicious food and drinks to the outstanding customer service. I highly recommend visiting this location for anyone in the area. I’ll definitely be back!

I am extremely disappointed with Barista. My family and I have been regular visitors for years, but today I experienced something completely unacceptable. For a take-away order, I was charged 10% of the bill as a “packaging fee.” When I checked an older dine-in bill, I noticed they also charge 10% as a service charge for dining in.

When I asked what this 10% packaging charge was for, the staff explained that it is for the paper cup! Charging a percentage of the entire bill is unreasonable and feels blatantly unfair.

It seems like a deliberate practice of applying a service charge like fee to take away orders under the disguise of a “packaging charge.”

I expressed my disappointment on the spot, but the explanation given made no sense. I also called the feedback number printed there for feedback, only to find that no one answers it, which makes the experience even more frustrating.

This incident has seriously damaged my trust in Barista. Customers deserve transparency and fair charging practices.",2025-12-07 17:29:00,"Rs 1–1,000",Other,4.4,4.4,1,500.5,2025,12,Sunday,17,"0 star

The food was absolutely delicious—I tried their cheesecake and some shakes, and both were spot on! The cheesecake was rich and creamy, while the shakes were refreshing and flavorful. They really maintain the quality Barista is known for.

Another major plus is the huge parking space available for customers, which is a big convenience, especially in a busy area like Kottawa. The overall environment was super cool, making it an ideal place to hang out, work, or just enjoy a quiet coffee break.

Barista has always been one of my go-to cafés in Sri Lanka for a great cup of coffee and a relaxed atmosphere. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the service is consistently good. The coffee is rich and aromatic, and their food menu—especially the sandwiches and desserts—pairs perfectly with it.

The main issue relates to an incorrect order. We ordered one large hot chocolate and one medium hot chocolate. The medium hot chocolate was correct. However after reaching home we realized that the large drink was not hot chocolate. Instead it appeared to be a coffee item which we did not order. This was very disappointing as we specifically ordered hot chocolate and paid for it.

The second issue concerns the seating policy. We arrived at the outlet around 9.50pm. While placing our order we politely requested whether we could stay until around 10.30 pm to enjoy our drinks. A staff member informed us that customers are not allowed to stay after 10.00 pm and that the order must be takeaway only. However at the same time there were other customers seated inside the outlet who were allowed to remain. This felt unfair and inconsistent.

This is the second issue we have faced at this outlet and the overall experience has left us dissatisfied. As customers we expect correct orders fair treatment and clear communication from staff.

I kindly request that this matter be reviewed and necessary action be taken to prevent such issues in the future.",2026-01-29 17:51:00,"Rs 3,000–4,000",,4,2,1,3500,2026,1,Thursday,17,"i am writing to formally complain about a service issue we experienced at the barista ethul kotte outlet during a recent visit

I’m writing this review while eating at Fashion Café in Colombo International Airport (March 23, 2025, 4:10 PM). We ordered rice with red curry and an idli combo with coffee. With a flight to catch at 5 PM, we expected a quick and smooth experience—but it turned out to be a total disaster.

After waiting over 15 minutes with no food, I went to the counter to follow up. They finally brought the rice and curry—stone cold, with a tiny portion of lentil curry and a heap of dry rice. The idli combo didn’t come until much later, and even then, it arrived without the coffee. We had to ask again, and despite repeated reminders, the coffee never came. We eventually had to leave without it to catch our flight.

The food was tasteless and felt stale—especially the chutneys, which seemed like they were made yesterday. To make matters worse, the staff appeared to serve Caucasian customers with a smile and warm welcome, while completely ignoring us (fellow South Asians). This kind of discriminatory behavior is unacceptable.

Do not be fooled by the “Sri Lankan curry” name or airport location—this place is a waste of time and money. Bad food, even worse service. Avoid at all costs.",2025-03-23 11:09:00,"Rs 5,000+",Lunch,1,1,1,5000,2025,3,Sunday,11,"terrible experience  would give zero stars if i could

CCTV for security is one thing, but listening in on people’s chats? Not okay at all. Super uncomfortable experience. Definitely won’t be going back, and I can’t recommend it to anyone until this issue is taken seriously.

If anyone from Barista sees this, please take this seriously. Listening to your customers’ private conversations is not just unethical, it’s a huge breach of trust.

As a regular customer of the Barista Nawala branch for over three months, I've consistently enjoyed it for work, breakfast, quick coffees, and to hangout with friends. However, I've recently become aware of a significant privacy issue: their CCTV cameras appear to be recording audio in addition to video.

There are no visible notices informing customers that CCTV cameras are in operation or, more critically, that audio is being recorded. Given that many of us often share sensitive personal information with friends and family in what we believe to be a private setting, this raises serious privacy concerns. The collection of audio without explicit consent or notification is a significant violation of customer privacy.

I hope Barista addresses this issue promptly by either disabling audio recording or clearly informing customers about it.",2025-06-16 07:48:00,"Rs 1,500–2,000",,1,4,4,1750,2025,6,Monday,7,"important privacy concern at barista  nawala branch

I have visited this Boralasgamuwa outlet 2 times. On my first visit, I paid for the food and plugged my laptop in to work, but their internet was slower than an old dial-up connection. I informed them, but they just ignored me and did their work. So I couldn't work and had to go to another outlet.

On the second visit, I check the internet speed before paying for food and drink. So I connected the laptop, but unfortunately, the internet isn't working this time. Went to the cashier and asked about the WIFi. Then the reply was that they don't have data and are not sure what time it will top up. Again, I went to the Piliyandala outlet as there's no point staying there anymore.

I called some of my friends who are close to this outlet, and they said they don't visit it because they always have Wi-Fi issues.

We stopped at Barista this morning for breakfast and coffee. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by a staff member at the door who even helped guide us with parking.  A great first impression.

My companion ordered a sandwich as well and we were both impressed by the flavor and freshness. Definitely worth trying when you’re passing through.

Special shoutout to the manager, who went out of his way to welcome us personally, check in on how we were doing during our visit, and even bid us farewell with the same cheerful energy he greeted us with. It’s rare to see such genuine hospitality and attention to detail these days, and it truly made our experience feel special.

However, I have stopped going to Barista due to their exorbitant prices. In addition they Charge 10% of the bill value for packaging when you take-away even while visiting a store.

I have sent a personal message to CEO Dilupa in this regard. However, I believe the only way that people respond is when things get highlighted publicly, which is unfortunate, I reckon.

Are you specifically a Dine-In only Café? if not why 10% packaging?? Does your brown paper bag cost 10% of your product price? If so you should change the supplier, instead of burdening the customer.

I am so done with these businesses in Sri Lanka who thinks they can do whatever. You should travel the world and see how a sustainable business operates.

I have visited this Boralasgamuwa outlet 2 times. On my first visit, I paid for the food and plugged my laptop in to work, but their internet was slower than an old dial-up connection. I informed them, but they just ignored me and did their work. So I couldn't work and had to go to another outlet.

On the second visit, I check the internet speed before paying for food and drink. So I connected the laptop, but unfortunately, the internet isn't working this time. Went to the cashier and asked about the WIFi. Then the reply was that they don't have data and are not sure what time it will top up. Again, I went to the Piliyandala outlet as there's no point staying there anymore.

I called some of my friends who are close to this outlet, and they said they don't visit it because they always have Wi-Fi issues.

That’s when we were greeted by Mr. Thisith, who quickly made things work by adding a chair to a two seater arrangement simple, thoughtful, and very much appreciated.

We ordered a hot chocolate, ham and cheese Turkish simit, iced caramel macchiato, and a Milo shake. Everything was delicious as always. However, things took an unexpected turn when we accidentally spilled the entire hot chocolate all over the table and floor a complete mess.

I went up to the cashier to let Mr. Thisith know what had happened. He immediately came over, cleaned the area, and handled the situation with such understanding and kindness that it completely took away the awkwardness of the moment.

The staff is warm and professional, making you feel truly welcome. After we finished our time there with chats, coffee, sandwiches, and cake, they even said, “Have a good day, sir. Please come again!” – a nice personal touch.

This was my second visit, and I’ll definitely be going again to work, meet friends, or have casual meetings. As always, coffee at Barista never disappoints.

The atmosphere is genuinely nice, and the customer support was excellent, but honestly, you expect those things when you're paying a premium.

The most important part of a coffee shop is the coffee itself, and this is where it fell completely flat. The prices are extremely high—the smallest cup of coffee starts at 500 rupees, plus a 300 rupees service charge. For that price, we were hoping for a rich, flavorful experience, but what we got was just bitter. No one in our family enjoyed it, and for such a small serving, the price feels unjustified. It feels like they have huge profit margins on a product that doesn't deliver on quality. We even signed up for their loyalty program, hoping for some good offers, but were disappointed to find there were no vouchers or discounts to be had. It's frustrating when other restaurants give you big discounts without any membership at all.

To put the prices into perspective, you could go to an international fast-food chain and get better food, service, and atmosphere for the same price. While the ambiance and service are good, they're not enough to make up for the core product being so poor and overpriced.",2025-08-19 13:02:00,"Rs 1–1,000",Other,3,1,5,500.5,2025,8,Tuesday,13,"my family and i visited this coffee shop today and while there were some things to like the experience ultimately left us disappointed the atmosphere is genuinely nice and the customer support was excellent but honestly you expect those things when youre paying a premium

When me, my husband and the baby went there, there was no space upstairs, and we sat close to the restroom. So, while my hubby was in a meeting, I waited with my daughter and I noticed some teenage boys were going to the washroom every time and stammering something. Earlier, I ignored it, but then recently one boy went, and two boys again ran there and talked to him like he had taken drugs or some kind of thing which was dangerous. Then, after some time, the same 2 guys went inside the washroom and locked the door. I was quite uncomfortable because, these days, teenage kids are used to being baristas, and they study and have some of their time. Btw, they get badly influenced by such things because no one notices this and no one can do anything here.as a mom, I know my kids are also coming here, so I spoke to the staff and asked them to check and mean time.

I have visited this Boralasgamuwa outlet 2 times. On my first visit, I paid for the food and plugged my laptop in to work, but their internet was slower than an old dial-up connection. I informed them, but they just ignored me and did their work. So I couldn't work and had to go to another outlet.

On the second visit, I check the internet speed before paying for food and drink. So I connected the laptop, but unfortunately, the internet isn't working this time. Went to the cashier and asked about the WIFi. Then the reply was that they don't have data and are not sure what time it will top up. Again, I went to the Piliyandala outlet as there's no point staying there anymore.

I called some of my friends who are close to this outlet, and they said they don't visit it because they always have Wi-Fi issues.

The whole point of visiting Barista is to do our work while having a coffee and eating some food. But what is the point if they don't have a proper internet connection?",2025-12-23 16:59:00,,,1,1,1,,2025,12,Tuesday,16,"this place is a scam

I’ve both dined-in and had take away from them, and both of my experiences exceeded expectations.

I was afraid establishments here might not meet the same standard as what I had abroad and that I would have to settle. Since every cafe I increasingly came across was either bad coffee or rude staff.
But not with Barista.
Their customer service is purely on another level, always so kind and patient.
Most importantly the care they take with the food.
If you order on uber eats the coffee doesn’t arrive half spilled and muffin half dry. Each item is carefully sealed with precautionary measures, so having it at home is just as good as having it at the cafe.

this experience was completely out of line with the warm and professional service ive come to expect from barista i urge the management to address this issue as such behaviour can leave a lasting negative impression",-0.0339285714285714

The ambience is pleasant and relaxed. Perfect for conversations or even some solo downtime with a laptop. The coffee is consistently good, and their selection of snacks and light bites complements the experience well. However, one area that needs improvement is service efficiency. On more than one occasion, I’ve experienced noticeable delays, even when the café wasn’t particularly busy. It can be frustrating when a simple order takes longer than expected, especially when you're on a tight schedule or trying to fit in a short break. That said, the staff are generally polite and accommodating, and the location is quite convenient.

The coffee machine seemed to be out of tune, and the taste was noticeably off. It was not just my opinion; most people in our group who ordered different drinks felt the same way. I ordered a single shot, which is usually simple enough to get right, but even that tasted strange. One of us had an iced Americano, and it looked and tasted different from what we are used to as well.

On a positive note, the customer service was decent. The staff were polite and attentive, so there was nothing wrong in that area.

When it comes to the atmosphere, the place did not really feel like the usual Barista experience. Normally, Barista cafés have a cozy and inviting vibe, but this location felt different. I am not sure if the management is trying a new approach or if it was just an off day, but the space felt too tight and cramped. When it gets crowded, it becomes very noisy because the tables are placed very close together, making it difficult to have a proper conversation.

I heard they are planning to expand the space in the future. Hopefully, once that happens, the overall experience will improve.

The main issue relates to an incorrect order. We ordered one large hot chocolate and one medium hot chocolate. The medium hot chocolate was correct. However after reaching home we realized that the large drink was not hot chocolate. Instead it appeared to be a coffee item which we did not order. This was very disappointing as we specifically ordered hot chocolate and paid for it.

The second issue concerns the seating policy. We arrived at the outlet around 9.50pm. While placing our order we politely requested whether we could stay until around 10.30 pm to enjoy our drinks. A staff member informed us that customers are not allowed to stay after 10.00 pm and that the order must be takeaway only. However at the same time there were other customers seated inside the outlet who were allowed to remain. This felt unfair and inconsistent.

But this Place changed my mine. 9.30pm, not many places to go to. This Barista was open supporting the businesses around.

The staff who greeted me was amazing. Forgive me for forgetting his name. He looked in to every detail of my order and brought back to me the magic that was lost from another Barista.

The sandwich I had was perfectly done and the coffee, he didn't make me spend on the big cup... I had the smallest, he recommended it - as it paired well with the sandwich - both flavour and sip to bite ratio.

When I asked if the matcha strawberry latte also has coffee, he said “matcha thiyena nisa thamai latte” kiyanne. In a very “bossy” atitude. Actually Nadil, you are mistaken. Latte in Italian is milk and in generally accepted standards when you say latte it means a coffee drink with espresso and milk. What you said doesn’t even make sense. Why would anyone call something a latte because it has matcha?

And about macchiato, again you made another mistake. When my husband wanted a macchiato and I asked Nadil whether the macchiato has only a little milk (less than a cappuccino) like it’s supposed to in actual coffee standards, he gave some bs answer saying yes, and then saying it’s 110ml and then when I asked to show the glass, showed a tall glass which shouldn’t be a machhiato cup at all. Maybe here Barista brand is at fault, but you should know how to clearly explain what the drink is as a professional barista should.

While taking our order he also gave a rude order to one of the employees saying “athule inna dennagen ekkenekta ennna kiyanna”. He didn’t sound like a good boss at all. He was rude and was I think trying to display his authority to us, the customer. This was highly unprofessional.

Then when I was waiting for my friends to decide which cake they want, he looked frustrated and impatient. This happened twice when I had to ask him to show me the frappes in the menu too. For every question I asked he was impatient to get the order. As someone who’s visiting Sri Lanka after 3 years I’m not familiar with what’s on the Barista menu. Mind you there were no customers behind us too. In the end one customer arrived behind us and then we wrapped up the order quickly.

His behavior was unprofessional and he should get some sort of training on customer service. We also thought maybe he may have been frustrated due to lack of employees in the festive season (31st December 2025). But this doesn’t justify his attitude towards customers and there were only a few customers in the cafe.

P.S. the person who served us the drinks were super nice and professional. This is the only reason I gave 2 stars for service.

The Blueberry Cheesecake was absolutely delicious – creamy, rich, and full of flavor. I loved every bite!
Then I tried the Turkish Simit ( Chicken, Ham & Cheese ) – super crispy and tasty. Really impressed with the food overall.

Drinks – Not So Great (2/10)
Unfortunately, the drinks were a letdown. The Caramel Macchiato had too much sugar – it was overly sweet and hard to finish.
The Double Chocolate Frappe wasn’t any better – again, too sweet and not enjoyable. I wouldn’t recommend the drinks here.

Place & Atmosphere
The Galle outlet is quite small compared to the one in Nuwara Eliya. While the inside is okay, the outdoor seating needs improvement. They use sewing machine parts as table bases, and most of them are wobbly – not the best when you’re trying to enjoy your food.
It would be better if they added more cozy and comfortable seating outside. Also, weekends can get a bit noisy outside, so if you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful spot, this might not be for you.

But if you’re okay with a small, crowded place that serves really good food (but not drinks), Barista Galle is worth a visit.

Staff – 10/10
One thing I have to say – the staff here are amazing. They were fast, friendly, and way better than the team at the Nuwara Eliya branch. Big thumbs up for that!

In short:
✔️ Must-try food
❌ Skip the drinks
⚖️ Cozy? Not really

While I appreciate the availability of a cool and comfortable environment, the existing furniture is significantly uncomfortable for prolonged periods of sitting.

Many customers, myself included, choose cafes for a comfortable space to work, study, or simply unwind. The current uncomfortable seating actively discourages longer stays and may even lead customers to seek out other establishments that prioritize comfort.

Investing in new, comfortable furniture that offers adequate support would be a significant improvement to your customer experience within the air-conditioned area. This upgrade would undoubtedly enhance customer satisfaction, encourage longer visits, and potentially attract more patrons seeking a truly relaxing and comfortable cafe environment.

Food – 10000/10: Blueberry Cheesecake, Death by Chocolate, Chocolate Brownie with Cream Cheese, Turkish Simit (chicken, ham & cheese), and the croissant were all mouthwatering. Must-try!

Drinks: (7/10)
Cappuccino was perfect (10/10)
Barista Blast was good (8/10)
Hot Chocolate average (6/10).So drinks are decent, but not as unforgettable as the food.

Atmosphere: (10/10) Super Spacious, cozy indoor seating with AC and a calm vibe, perfect for working. Outdoor area is also spacious and nice but chairs need better cleaning. Not crowded, quiet environment – I even met other work-from-café people.

Staff – 10/10: Super friendly, polite, fast. They greeted us warmly when we walked in and even said goodbye politely when we left that I didn't notice in Nuwara Eliya cafe as well as Galle fort cafe. Highly Appriciate

Facilities: Clean washrooms, and I really appreciate that they provide sanitary napkins (Fems brand) – It’s the first time I’ve seen that in a café here – such a thoughtful touch.

But honestly, the experience has been really hit or miss. Almost half the time, there’s something wrong. Sometimes the rice is way too oily, other times the chicken barely has any gravy. Still, I kept ordering because when it’s done right, it really is delicious.

Whenever the rice was too oily, I didn’t complain. I just replaced it with my own rice at home and enjoyed the chicken. But today was a different story. The rice wasn’t just oily or dry. It was undercooked and completely inedible. I was really hungry, and as frustrated as I was, I still called and calmly explained the issue without being rude.

What happened next really upset me. The person on the phone asked the chef if there was anything wrong with the rice, and I could hear them say it was made like usual. That made me feel like I wasn’t being taken seriously. Why would I lie about rice being undercooked? What would I gain from that? It felt like I was being treated as if I was making it up.

I told the person on the phone that I’ve eaten rice my whole life. I can tell when it’s properly cooked. Eventually, she agreed to replace the meal and asked for my address. Since I live just five minutes away, I offered to send my location via WhatsApp so it would be easier to find me. She took down my number and said she’d message me.

The thing is, when you mess up someone’s breakfast, especially when they’ve been patient and loyal, the least you can do is fix it quickly. Instead, I’ve been left waiting with no message, no call, nothing.

I’m really disappointed with how this was handled, especially by the Ja-Ela branch. I won’t be ordering from here again. I don’t want a replacement now, and I don’t want anyone reaching out to me about this. I’ve already spent more time on this than I should have for a meal that should have been simple and enjoyable.",2025-05-06 04:40:00,,,3,1,1,,2025,5,Tuesday,4,"ive always loved the lemongrass chicken rice at barista and its been one of my goto meals but honestly the experience has been really hit or miss almost half the time theres something wrong sometimes the rice is way too oily other times the chicken barely has any gravy still i kept ordering because when its done right it really is delicious

He’s the person behind almost all the coffees I’ve had there, and his dedication truly shows.

Every cup he makes feels unique — especially the coffee art, which is always elegant, creative, and done with so much attention to detail. The design he made on my drink is just one example of how much effort he puts into his craft. It’s not something you see every day.

Beyond the art, his service is friendly, consistent, and professional. It’s rare to find someone who enjoys what they do and makes the customer feel that passion with every cup.

The rich aroma of coffee instantly draws you in, while the peaceful ambience makes it a perfect place to unwind. It’s an ideal spot to focus on your studies, office work, or simply relax for hours, all while enjoying premium coffee and delicious snacks.

Their coffee selection is top-notch, with high-quality brews. During our visit, we tried Caffe latte and Green apple fizz.The Cafe latte was exceptional as usual, offering a rich flavor blending milk and cofee. It was my first time with a fizz and it gave a different authentic vibe.

Unfortunately, we had a disappointing experience even before we could step inside. The staff informed us that the parking area was only for cars and refused to let us park our bike there, despite the area being completely empty at the time.

Instead, we were asked to park in a spot directly under the hot sun where a person was actively collecting garbage—not exactly a welcoming or hygienic environment.

This kind of attitude from the staff was very disappointing and unprofessional. A brand like Barista should treat all customers with equal respect, regardless of how they travel. We expected better.

I recently visited Barista Malabe, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed by a warm and friendly staff who made me feel at home. The ambiance was cozy and well-designed, making it a perfect spot for both work and relaxation.

The coffee was exceptional—rich in flavor, perfectly brewed, and served at the right temperature. I tried their cappuccino, and it had a great balance of espresso and frothy milk. Their menu also offers a good variety of snacks and desserts, and I particularly enjoyed their chocolate brownie, which was fresh and delicious.

What stood out most was the excellent customer service. The baristas were attentive, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. They even recommended a customized drink based on my preferences, which I really appreciated.

The cleanliness and organization of the café were also impressive, creating a pleasant and hygienic environment. Whether you’re looking for a quiet place to work, catch up with friends, or simply enjoy a great cup of coffee, Barista Malabe is the perfect choice.

I initially gave 3 stars since they got my order wrong. Then they have corrected it and offered a replacement. Which is the very best way to handle customer satisfaction.

During my second visit to the restaurant, on my holiday in Sri Lanka, we ordered an Oreo milkshake. My kid loves to have an Oreo milkshake and last time they got the order correct and it was perfect. During my second visit, a trainee did the order and apparently, there were no baristas to properly guide him. Also, the trainee was careless. The cashier told him the milkshake was for take away and he made it to have it there. Then he simply poured it into the takeaway container (which is absolutely fine if it was the right drink we ordered) and gave it to us.

Unfortunately, the drink was wrong. It was a plain chocolate milkshake and not an Oreo milkshake. I believe when trainees are making food and drinks, senior staff members have to make sure whether they have made it properly or not. Sadly, there was no quality control or check. I saw the trainee ask for ingredients several times and I didn’t see that the trainee got enough guidance to make the drink.
Finally, a huge disappointment for the kid. 

Later I visited there to get a new drink for my kid to console her and they offered me a free drink to rectify the issue. Which was a massive support from their end.

Barista Mirissa,Coffee shop,"Sri Ramya, Galle road, Mirissa, Sri Lanka",Mirissa,5.9475594,80.4578832,4.5,461,David Bourgeois,4,"I came to Barista 3 times for hot Americano coffee during my stay in Mirissa.  Pros: 1. The coffee's taste was good (not too strong or weak). 2. The staff were polite - especially at the Mirissa location. 3. The seats at the cafe were comfortable and the widow seats provided a nice view of what was happening outside.

Cons:  10% Service Charge added to my bill without my being told by the staff. And is it normal to add a service charge to just a cup of coffee in Sri Lanka?

Unfortunately, our experience at the Moratuwa outlet didn’t quite live up to those expectations. The space itself is gorgeous—great interior, lots of natural light, and a really inviting upper floor. We first visited during a busy time and figured the noise was just a one-off. So we gave it another shot early in the morning, planning to get some work done.

But even then, the upper floor had two different types of music playing from separate speakers plus a TV playing a promotional video at the same time. It was extremely overstimulating. We politely asked if one audio source could be turned off and the volume lowered on the other (we were the only customers there), and while they turned one off, they refused to reduce the volume on the rest.

We moved downstairs, but it was still very noisy. The music volume was high and the baristas were unreasonably loud—banging things around and even singing along to the music. We've never encountered that at other Barista outlets, even the compact Katubedda one, where you’re seated right next to the counter and it still manages to stay peaceful and staff are considerate of the space.

The dismissiveness from the staff was the most disappointing part—they weren’t open to compromise or even a bit of accommodation, which really stood out in contrast to the service we’ve come to associate with Barista. In the end, we called the Boralesgamuwa outlet to ask if we could bring our food there and work instead—and as always, they were super welcoming and happy to help out.

All in all, Barista Moratuwa has so much potential thanks to its lovely setting, but the staff experience and ambience management seriously need some attention to make it as inviting and work-friendly as the other branches.",2025-07-17 08:07:00,"Rs 500–1,000",Other,2,4,2,750,2025,7,Thursday,8,"weve always loved the barista brand for its warm ambience and workfriendly vibeespecially at outlets like boralesgamuwa and the tiny but cozy katubedda cargills mall one where the staff are consistently friendly the environment is calm and working for hours never feels like a hassle

CCTV for security is one thing, but listening in on people’s chats? Not okay at all. Super uncomfortable experience. Definitely won’t be going back, and I can’t recommend it to anyone until this issue is taken seriously.

As a regular customer of the Barista Nawala branch for over three months, I've consistently enjoyed it for work, breakfast, quick coffees, and to hangout with friends. However, I've recently become aware of a significant privacy issue: their CCTV cameras appear to be recording audio in addition to video.

There are no visible notices informing customers that CCTV cameras are in operation or, more critically, that audio is being recorded. Given that many of us often share sensitive personal information with friends and family in what we believe to be a private setting, this raises serious privacy concerns. The collection of audio without explicit consent or notification is a significant violation of customer privacy.

I hope Barista addresses this issue promptly by either disabling audio recording or clearly informing customers about it.",2025-06-16 07:48:00,"Rs 1,500–2,000",,1,4,4,1750,2025,6,Monday,7,"important privacy concern at barista  nawala branch

A few weeks ago, after office hours, I visited the café to unwind after a stressful day at work. The café was crowded, so two customers who ordered after me sat at my table since there was no space. Surprisingly, their orders were served first. I waited patiently for over 25 minutes, only to find out later that my order hadn’t even been prepared.
When the drink finally arrived, it was extremely disappointing — filled mostly with ice, barely any coffee, and the milk tasted diluted with water. Considering the price, it felt like a complete waste, especially when I had come in hoping to relax after a long day.
Yesterday’s experience was even worse. After an exhausting month-end workload, I stopped by to buy sandwiches for dinner since no one was home. At the counter, I was told that no sandwiches were available, even though I could clearly see sandwiches displayed and being served to other customers. When I asked what was available, I was told “nothing.”
This left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and disheartened. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was treated differently because I came straight from work — tired, simply dressed, and not “fashionably” presentable. Whether intentional or not, the experience felt unfair and discriminatory.
This café is located in a business park, meant to serve all hardworking professionals, not just those who look polished or dressed a certain way. A customer is a customer, regardless of appearance.
Sadly, this has been one of the worst café service experiences I’ve had. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and ensures fair, respectful treatment for everyone.",2026-01-31 08:42:00,,,4.7,4.7,4.7,,2026,1,Saturday,8,"ive had two very disappointing experiences at barista recently and i feel compelled to share this

Whenever I have work or errands in Negombo, Barista is my go-to spot. I often settle in here with a coffee and catch up on work—especially helpful when I don’t have time to head back home or to the office.

Sometimes, I also choose to work from Barista just to switch up the environment and recharge my mood. It helps reduce stress and boosts productivity. When I visit Negombo with my family, it’s also our favorite place to relax. Our usual orders? An Americano for me, a Caramel Macchiato for my wife, and an Oreo Shake for my son!

The café is always clean and well-maintained, the atmosphere is peaceful, and the staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Even the customers who frequent the place are respectful, which adds to the comfort.

One special thing that stood out to me was how this Barista branch takes extra care with their sanitary facilities, including providing sanitary pads in the restrooms. That level of consideration shows how much they care about their customers' well-being. It's a thoughtful initiative that more outlets—and public places—should follow.

Manager Dhanushka is a humble, pleasant, and practical person who, along with his team, always prioritizes customer convenience. I’ve visited many Barista branches across the country, but the Negombo branch truly stands out as the best.

The atmosphere is genuinely nice, and the customer support was excellent, but honestly, you expect those things when you're paying a premium.

The most important part of a coffee shop is the coffee itself, and this is where it fell completely flat. The prices are extremely high—the smallest cup of coffee starts at 500 rupees, plus a 300 rupees service charge. For that price, we were hoping for a rich, flavorful experience, but what we got was just bitter. No one in our family enjoyed it, and for such a small serving, the price feels unjustified. It feels like they have huge profit margins on a product that doesn't deliver on quality. We even signed up for their loyalty program, hoping for some good offers, but were disappointed to find there were no vouchers or discounts to be had. It's frustrating when other restaurants give you big discounts without any membership at all.

To put the prices into perspective, you could go to an international fast-food chain and get better food, service, and atmosphere for the same price. While the ambiance and service are good, they're not enough to make up for the core product being so poor and overpriced.",2025-08-19 13:02:00,"Rs 1–1,000",Other,3,1,5,500.5,2025,8,Tuesday,13,"my family and i visited this coffee shop today and while there were some things to like the experience ultimately left us disappointed the atmosphere is genuinely nice and the customer support was excellent but honestly you expect those things when youre paying a premium

When me, my husband and the baby went there, there was no space upstairs, and we sat close to the restroom. So, while my hubby was in a meeting, I waited with my daughter and I noticed some teenage boys were going to the washroom every time and stammering something. Earlier, I ignored it, but then recently one boy went, and two boys again ran there and talked to him like he had taken drugs or some kind of thing which was dangerous. Then, after some time, the same 2 guys went inside the washroom and locked the door. I was quite uncomfortable because, these days, teenage kids are used to being baristas, and they study and have some of their time. Btw, they get badly influenced by such things because no one notices this and no one can do anything here.as a mom, I know my kids are also coming here, so I spoke to the staff and asked them to check and mean time.

Are you specifically a Dine-In only Café? if not why 10% packaging?? Does your brown paper bag cost 10% of your product price? If so you should change the supplier, instead of burdening the customer.

That’s when we were greeted by Mr. Thisith, who quickly made things work by adding a chair to a two seater arrangement simple, thoughtful, and very much appreciated.

We ordered a hot chocolate, ham and cheese Turkish simit, iced caramel macchiato, and a Milo shake. Everything was delicious as always. However, things took an unexpected turn when we accidentally spilled the entire hot chocolate all over the table and floor a complete mess.

I went up to the cashier to let Mr. Thisith know what had happened. He immediately came over, cleaned the area, and handled the situation with such understanding and kindness that it completely took away the awkwardness of the moment. After the cleanup, I went back to order another hot chocolate, since I hadn’t tasted a drop before the spill, but they insisted it was on them and gave me a new one for free.

The ambience was lovely as well—comfy sofas, airy spaces, and a relaxed vibe that made us want to stay longer.

The coffee machine seemed to be out of tune, and the taste was noticeably off. It was not just my opinion; most people in our group who ordered different drinks felt the same way. I ordered a single shot, which is usually simple enough to get right, but even that tasted strange. One of us had an iced Americano, and it looked and tasted different from what we are used to as well.

On a positive note, the customer service was decent. The staff were polite and attentive, so there was nothing wrong in that area.

When it comes to the atmosphere, the place did not really feel like the usual Barista experience. Normally, Barista cafés have a cozy and inviting vibe, but this location felt different. I am not sure if the management is trying a new approach or if it was just an off day, but the space felt too tight and cramped. When it gets crowded, it becomes very noisy because the tables are placed very close together, making it difficult to have a proper conversation.

I heard they are planning to expand the space in the future. Hopefully, once that happens, the overall experience will improve.

 Parking: there’s parking enough for like 3 cars

 Music: a tiny bit loud, so I don't think its the most ideal place to take work meetings. But it's the perfect spot to chill.

On 2025/11/23, I visited this outlet and noticed there was a kiosk machine with the tagline ‘SKIP THE LINE & SAVE TIME!’. Because of that, I decided not to purchase in the normal way and instead placed my order through the kiosk. I made the payment around 5:40 pm, and I received my order at about 6:20 pm. I understand that it was a busy day, so the delay is acceptable.

However, the issue is that I selected ‘dine-in’, but my order was given to me as ‘takeaway’. When I told the employee who handed me the order, he said the outlet had run out of plates, which is why they changed it to takeaway. If that was the case, I should have been informed first, but no one told me anything.

Another thing is that a customer who came after me, and who ordered in the normal way—not through the kiosk—received their order around 6:10 pm.

So I have two concerns:

If kiosk machine orders are delayed like this, then why display a tagline like that?

The fact that the outlet didn’t have plates is not my problem, but I should have been informed beforehand.

I’ve never had any issues with any outlet before. This is the first time something like this has happened, but please make sure the staff are informed properly to avoid such situations in the future.

I visited the Barista at Staple Street, which is located inside Lakarcade. So you enter through the main entrance of the Lakarcade building. It’s a lovely place with a warm and inviting atmosphere. You can enjoy your coffee either indoors or in the outdoor seating area, both offering a nice vibe to relax.

I ordered the Kochchi Chicken Bagel and a café mocha. Both were fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly and provided great service throughout. Definitely a nice spot to unwind or catch up with friends over coffee.

One great thing is that it’s also a good spot to work. The atmosphere is calm and comfortable, making it suitable for working while enjoying your coffee.

Definitely a place I’d recommend and visit again!",2025-05-05 10:06:00,"Rs 1,500–2,000",Brunch,4,4,4,1750,2025,5,Monday,10,"cozy spot with great service  barista at staple street lakarcade
